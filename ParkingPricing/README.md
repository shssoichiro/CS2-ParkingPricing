# Parking Pricing

A mod for Cities Skylines II that automatically adjusts prices of parking spots in your city based on demand.
Will work with any paid parking, including lots, garages, and integrated parking for public transit stations, etc.

NOTE: Street parking must be inside a district for pricing to be adjusted,
since we use the district policy for street parking.
