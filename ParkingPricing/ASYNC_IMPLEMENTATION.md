# Async Performance Implementation

## Overview

The ParkingPricingSystem has been refactored to use Unity's Job System to address stop-the-world performance issues in large cities with many parking structures and districts.

## Problem Solved

- **Issue**: The original synchronous `OnUpdate` method caused noticeable frame drops/pauses in cities with large numbers of parking structures or districts
- **Root Cause**: Heavy computational work (utilization calculations) was blocking the main thread
- **Impact**: Poor user experience in large cities

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Job System Implementation

- **CalculateDistrictUtilizationJob**: Parallel calculation of street parking utilization per district
- **CalculateBuildingUtilizationJob**: Parallel calculation of building parking utilization
- **ApplyPricingUpdatesJob**: Batch processing of price calculations
- **Burst Compilation**: All jobs use `[BurstCompile]` for maximum performance

### 2. Async Processing Flow

```
Frame N:   Check if previous job completed
           ├─ If completed: Apply results to entities (main thread)
           └─ If not completed: Skip frame, return early

Frame N+1: Start new async job chain
           ├─ Schedule district utilization jobs (parallel)
           ├─ Schedule building utilization jobs (parallel)
           └─ Schedule pricing calculation job (depends on above)
```

### 3. Memory Management

- Uses `Allocator.TempJob` for job-specific arrays
- Proper disposal in `OnDestroy()` and after applying updates
- No memory leaks from job scheduling

## Performance Benefits

### Before (Synchronous)

- All work done on main thread in single frame
- Processing time: O(districts × parking_lanes + buildings × parking_lanes)
- Caused frame drops proportional to city size
- Blocked rendering and input processing

### After (Async)

- Heavy computation moved to job threads
- Main thread only handles job coordination and result application
- Processing distributed across multiple frames
- Frame rate remains stable regardless of city size

## Technical Implementation Details

### Job Scheduling

```csharp
// Parallel processing across multiple threads
var districtJobHandle = districtJob.Schedule(districtEntities.Length, 1, default);
var buildingJobHandle = buildingJob.Schedule(buildingEntities.Length, 1, default);

// Chain dependencies
var pricingJobHandle = pricingJob.Schedule(combinedJobHandle);
```

### Thread Safety

- All job data marked with `[ReadOnly]` where appropriate
- No shared mutable state between jobs
- Results passed via `NativeArray` with proper lifetime management

### Fallback Behavior

- If mod settings are null, system gracefully skips processing
- Individual entity processing failures don't crash entire system
- Proper error logging maintained

## Usage Notes

### For Developers

- Job system requires Unity DOTS packages
- All job structs must be blittable (no managed references)
- Component lookups must be updated before job scheduling

### For Users

- No configuration changes needed
- Parking pricing updates now happen smoothly in background
- Large cities will see significant performance improvement
- Update frequency setting still controls how often prices recalculate

## Monitoring

The system logs async operation progress:

- "Starting async parking pricing update" - Job scheduling begins
- "Async parking pricing update completed" - Results applied to entities
- Individual entity price updates with utilization percentages

## Future Improvements

- Could add frame time budgeting to spread result application across multiple frames
- Potential for job scheduling priority adjustment based on city size
- Consider caching frequently accessed component data to reduce lookup overhead
